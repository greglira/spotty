# Spotty Commands

- __Start an instance__:

  ```
  spotty start  [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] [--dry-run] [INSTANCE_NAME]
  ```

  Runs an instance, synchronizes the project with that instance and starts the Docker container.

  Use the `--dry-run` flag to display the steps that will be performed without actually running them.

- __Stop an instance__:

  ```
  spotty stop [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] [INSTANCE_NAME]
  ```

  Terminates the running instance and applies deletion policies for the volumes.

- __Connect to an instance__:

  ```
  spotty ssh [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] [-H] [-s SESSION_NAME] [-l]
             [INSTANCE_NAME]
  ```

  Connects to the running Docker container or to the instance itself. Use the `-H` flag to connect to the host OS 
  instead of the Docker container.

- __Sync the project with an instance__:

  ```
  spotty sync [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] [--dry-run] [INSTANCE_NAME]
  ```

  Synchronizes the project with the running instance. It happens 
  automatically the first time when you start an instance.

- __Download files from an instance__:

  ```
  spotty download [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] -i PATTERN [--dry-run]
                  [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

  Downloads files from the running instance. The `PATTERN` parameter has the same format and works in the same way as 
  __Include Filters__ for the `aws s3 sync` command: see [Sync Filters]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/configuration-file/#project-section).

- __Run a custom script on an instance:__

  ```
  spotty run [-h] [-d] [-c CONFIG] [-s SESSION_NAME] [-S] [-l] [-r]
             [-p PARAMETER=VALUE]
             [INSTANCE_NAME] SCRIPT_NAME
  ```

  Runs a custom script inside the Docker container (see "scripts" section in 
  [Configuration File]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/configuration-file/#scripts-section-optional)).

  Use the __`Ctrl + b`__, then __`x`__ combination of keys to kill tmux window with the process.

  Use the __`Ctrl + b`__, then __`d`__ combination of keys to be detached from the SSH session. The script will keep running. 
  Call the `spotty run` command again to be reattached to the running script. 
  Read more about tmux here: [tmux Wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki){:target="_blank"}.

  If you need to run the same script several times in parallel, use the `-s` parameter to
  specify a different name for a tmux session.

  To restart a running script, use the `-r` flag.

  To synchronize the project with the instance before running a script, use the `-S` flag.
  
  Scripts can be parametrized. Parameters in a script are indicated by double braces. For example, 
  {% raw %}`echo {{msg1}} {{msg2}}`{% endraw %}. Use the `-p` parameter to replace script parameters with real values: 
  `-p msg1=deep -p msg2=learning`. If some script parameters were not provided, they will be replaced with
  empty strings.

All the commands have the `-c` parameter to specify a path to the configuration file. By default, Spotty is looking for 
a `spotty.yaml` file in the current working directory.
